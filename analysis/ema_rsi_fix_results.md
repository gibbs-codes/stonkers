## Problem Statement

Session 4 diagnostic revealed the EMA+RSI strategy was **catching falling knives**:

- Trades at RSI 38-41 (just above oversold) had **20% win rate**
- Trades at RSI 50-52 (stronger recovery) had **100% win rate**
- Entries at 0-0.2% distance from EMA had **25% win rate** (noise)
- Entries at 0.6-0.8% distance from EMA had **75% win rate** (real dislocation)

## Recommendation

### Use **Conservative** Configuration

The diagnostic-driven fixes successfully addressed the falling knife problem:

1. **Higher RSI threshold** filters out weak bounces that fail
2. **Minimum distance filter** skips noise near EMA
3. **Win rate improved** from 47.6% to 50.0%
4. **P&L improved** by $+5.16
