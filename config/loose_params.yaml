# Loose parameters for signal generation testing
# Goal: maximize signal count to understand strategy behavior
# These are NOT for production - use strategy_params.yaml for live trading
#
# Diagnostic findings (15-min candles, 30-day window):
#   Momentum Thrust: ROC range observed -2.5% to +2.7%, volume often near 0
#   VWAP Mean Rev:   Price near bands but cross + volume rarely align together
#   SR Breakout:     Breakouts found but retest never hits within 5-candle window
#
# Target signal counts (30 days, ETH + SOL):
#   Momentum Thrust:  10-20 signals
#   VWAP Mean Rev:    10-15 signals
#   SR Breakout:       5-10 signals

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MOMENTUM THRUST
# Key lever: entry_threshold (ROC % to trigger) + volume_multiplier
# ROC maxes at ~2.7% on 15-min, so 1.5% catches real moves without noise.
# Volume gating dropped to 0.3x — 15-min candle volume is unreliable.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
momentum_thrust:
  roc_period: 10
  entry_threshold: 1.5       # was 2.0 → catches 1.5%+ moves (well within observed range)
  exit_threshold: 0.5        # was 1.0 → tighter neutral zone
  volume_multiplier: 0.3     # was 0.8 → near-zero volume on 15-min, stop gating
  min_signal_strength: 0.3   # was 0.5 → let weak-but-real signals through

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VWAP MEAN REVERSION
# Key lever: std_multiplier (band width) + volume_threshold + stretch_factor
# Lowering std_multiplier widens acceptance (price doesn't need to stretch as far).
# volume_threshold at 0.3x = effectively off. stretch_factor at 0.4 matches.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vwap_mean_rev:
  vwap_period: 45
  std_multiplier: 1.0        # was 1.3 → wider bands = more crosses qualify
  volume_threshold: 0.3      # was 1.0 → volume was blocking every valid cross
  min_signal_strength: 0.3   # was 0.5 → accept weaker setups
  stretch_factor: 0.4        # was 0.8 → min stretch = 1.0 * 0.4 = 0.4σ, very permissive

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SUPPORT / RESISTANCE BREAKOUT
# Key lever: retest_candles (window) + retest_tolerance + min_touches
# The retest was the killer — 5 candles is ~75 min, not enough for crypto to pull back.
# 20 candles = 5 hours. Tolerance at 2.5% lets a "close enough" retest count.
# min_touches=1 allows single-touch levels (more levels = more breakout candidates).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
support_resistance_breakout:
  lookback_period: 100       # was 80 → more history = more levels identified
  level_tolerance: 0.02      # was 0.012 → wider clustering catches more levels
  min_touches: 1             # was 2 → single-touch levels are valid candidates
  volume_multiplier: 0.7     # was 1.15 → stop requiring volume spike on breakout
  retest_candles: 20         # was 5 → give 5 hours for retest (was only 75 min)
  retest_tolerance: 0.025    # was 0.01 → 2.5% proximity = realistic for crypto
  min_signal_strength: 0.4   # was 0.65 → accept weaker bounce/rejection confirms
